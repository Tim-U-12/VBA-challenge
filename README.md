VBA-Script.bas
This macro loops through an excel sheet containing stock prices throughout a year. It creates a summary table that displays a unique stock's yearly change, percentage change and total stock volume. As a bonus, the macro also finds the stock with the greatest percentage increase, percentage decrease and the greatest total volume.
